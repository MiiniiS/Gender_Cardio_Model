# Gender_Cardio_Model
"This repository explores the cardiac profiles of different genders. Using data analysis and machine learning, this project attempts to find patterns and create profiles of cardiac characteristics. The goal is to provide insight into gender based cardiac differences."

This repository contains code and data for a project focused on developing comprehensive cardiac profiles based on multifactorial data on basics of Gender . We aim to analyze and model the complex relationships between various demographic and physiological factors, including: Dataset Contain :

Gender
Age
Weight
Height
BMI (Body Mass Index)
Body Temperature
Calories Burned
Heart Rate
Dependencies
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Project Objectives
Develop a robust model to predict heart rate based on the aforementioned multifactorial data and Gender.

Analyze and visualize the influence of each parameter on cardiac activity.

Identify significant correlations and patterns in cardiac data.

Create detailed cardiac profiles that highlight gender-specific differences.

Contribute to a deeper understanding of cardiovascular health and potentially inform future gender-specific healthcare strategies.

Methodology
This project utilizes:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the raw data for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing data to improve model performance.
Statistical Analysis: Exploring correlations and distributions using statistical methods.
Machine Learning: Employing regression models (e.g., Random Forest Regression) to predict heart rate and identify important features.
Data Visualization: Creating informative plots and charts to communicate findings.
Model
The model implemented in this project is a [Regression Random Forest].

Algorithm: [Regression Random Forest].

Performance Metrics: [Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (RÂ²). ]
